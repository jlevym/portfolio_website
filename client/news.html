  <h1>Focus on Thailand</h1>

<p>It seems that everyone is going to Thailand right now. I have friends thinking about going, friends going, and friends there already. It must be all that snow and cold weather in the Northern hemisphere right now! At the end of last year, I spent a considerable amount of time in the city. It’s one of my favorite cities in the world.

Bangkok usually leaves travelers unimpressed, given its pollution, traffic, and lack of tourist attractions. I played tour guide to a few friends when I was in the city and, while they enjoyed the food and nightlife, they didn’t think there was much to do. And they’re right — there isn’t much to do here in the traditional tourist sense, and most people can’t wait to get out.

I used to feel that way until I lived here and saw that Bangkok actually has a lot to offer. It just reveals its secrets slowly to those with the time to explore the hidden gems of this megacity. It requires you to leave the tourist ghettos of Khao San and Silom and find a city full of things to do, places to eat, and bars, clubs, and sites to visit. </p>

<h3>What to See and Do in Bangkok</h3>

<h4>Bangkok Royal Palace</h4>
Below are my favorite places to visit and things to see:

<h4>The Grand Palace</h4>
Hours: 8:30am–3:30pm daily. Price: 500 baht
This is Thailand’s royal palace. It was built at the end of the 18th century by King Rama I and is the official residence of the current monarch (though he doesn’t actually live there anymore; now it’s just used for ceremonies). It’s a beautiful palace filled with numerous temples, including Wat Pra Kaeo, which houses the 15th-century Emerald Buddha statue, whose robes are rotated three times a year by the king himself.

<h4>The Jim Thompson House</h4>
Hours: 9am– 5pm daily; the last guided tour starts at 5pm. Price: 150 baht, discounts for students
Jim Thompson was a former American spy and silk merchant in Thailand during the 1950s and 1960s. He built his traditionally Thai home in Bangkok and decorated it with beautiful teak wood furniture and a surrounding garden. He vanished mysteriously in 1967 while in Malaysia. His house is now a monument to traditional Thai architecture. A visit here is one of my favorite things to do in the city. The proceeds are used to help underprivileged kids.

<h4>Wat Arun</h4>
Hours: 8:30am–5pm daily. Price: 50 baht
This is a gorgeous Buddhist temple on the edge of the Chao Phraya River opposite the Grand Palace. It has one main spire and four small ones and is so iconic that you’ll find it on Thai money. From the top of the main spire, you get sweeping views of the city, making for amazing photographs during sunrise and sunset. The stairs are steep, so be careful.


<h3>Where to Eat</h3>

Food in Bangkok
Bangkok has some of the best Thai and international food in the world, and there’s nothing you can’t get (except Ethiopian, as that restaurant recently closed). Whenever I leave Bangkok, I miss the variety of food I can get in the city. Within walking distance of my apartment are delicious local food, great Mexican, good Italian, and one of my all-time favorite sushi places. You can eat like a king in this city.

My favorite markets are:

Chinatown (You can’t go wrong with anywhere in Chinatown!)
Little Arabia (Middle Eastern food)
Nang Loeng (fairly close to Democracy Monument)
Ramkamhaeng (opposite Ramkamhaeng University)
Soi Rambuttri (at the end, near the 7-Eleven)
Sukhumvit Soi 33 (Amazing Pad Thai, soup, and noodle vendors)
Victory Monument
(I don’t eat at a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can’t list much else other than markets, but for a list of Thai restaurants in Bangkok, visit Migrationology. He knows the best places.)

After gorging on Thai food, you might want to get something else. Unfortunately, all the really good international food is pretty expensive. Compared to back home, it’s not expensive, but by local standards, it’s pricey. I love good food as much as the next person, but I hate paying a lot for it. So after a few years living in Bangkok, I’ve managed to find a few good deals. Here are some of my favorite and reasonably priced Western restaurants:

<h4>Bella Napoli</h4>
This is my favorite Italian place in Bangkok. You’ll get the best pizza in the city, along with other delicious Italian specialties.

<h4>Charley Brown’s Mexican Cuisine</h4>
You won’t find a lot of good Mexican food in Asia, but this place comes close. Owned by an American who knows his stuff, it’s very popular with expats, and they do a big happy hour on Sunday nights.

<h4>Isao</h4>
This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the entire world. Everything here is delicious. There’s a robust menu and constantly changing specials. Make sure you try the Winter Roll — it’s my favorite.

<h4>La Monita Taqueria</h4>
This hip, new Mexican place serves strong drinks and spicy food!

<h4>May Kaidee’s Vegetarian Restaurant</h4>
Located near Khao San Road, this restaurant is an institution in Bangkok and serves the best vegetarian Thai food in the area. Try the Massaman curry and spring rolls — they’re heavenly. They also offer cooking classes.

<h4>Moghul Room</h4>
Bangkok has a lot of Indian restaurants, but this one’s my favorite. It’s located across from Cheap Charlie’s Bar and features northern Indian food. Try the thali, as you’ll get the best of everything they make.
